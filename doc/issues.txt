Issues faced during developing Kankor

----------
( ! ) Warning: include() [<a href='function.include'>function.include</a>]: It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'America/New_York' for '-5.0/no DST' instead in C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs\kankor\controllers\question_controller.class.php on line 3

	Solution: Uncommented date.timezone and set the value of America/New_York to it.


------------
( ! ) Warning: include(../models/Question.class.php) [<a href='function.include'>function.include</a>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs\kankor\controllers\Question_Controller.class.php on line 3

	Solution: Use dirname() and __DIR__ instead of relative paths in include and require.

-------------
json_encode() not working for question. Returns empty json.

	Cause: json_encode() can not encode objects with private properties.

	Solution:
	Added a toJson() method to Question class as following:

	public function toJson()
	{
		return json_encode(get_object_vars($this));
	}

	And added a toJson() method to Question_Controller class which encodes the $questions associative array as Json:

	public function toJson($assocArray)
	{
		$jsonText = '{' . PHP_EOL;
		$c = 0;
		foreach ($assocArray as $key => $value)
		{
			$jsonText .= $key . ':';
			$jsonText .= $value->toJson() . PHP_EOL;
		}
		$jsonText .= '}';
		return $jsonText;
	}
